          <h2 class="card-title">About Me</h2>
          <p class="card-text">I was born in October 1984 in Orlando, Florida, where I graduated from Boone High School and had an education focused on biology. I eventually attened the University of Florida where I majored in microbiology and eventually earned my BS degree. After college I decided to move to Oregon, as my mom had moved here many years prior due to work and I had fallen in love with the atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
          <p class="card-text">I took jobs in the food production industry, mostly as a QA lab technician. I eventually ended up at Pacific Foods, where I worked the night shift overseeing the quality of various soups and broths. I worked my way to a role that mostly involved reviewing production records for errors and educating new employees about food safety. I eventually became a bit bored with my line of work; desiring a more challenging and fulfilling career. I therefore joined up with the Epicodus coding bootcamp in August of 2021 and am currently looking to expand my skillset and broaden my understanding of coding, with my eye towards making it a full-time career.</p>

      <h4>What I Enjoy</h4>
      <p>Of course, I'm developing a passion for coding and learning all I can about it! I'm also into hiking, anime, Dungeons and Dragons, and all things Tolkien related. I'm <em>trying</em> to learn how to snowboard, but I still haven't quite mastered standing upright. And of course I'm into video games, as any self-respecting computer nerd.</p>
      <p>Some of the games I've spent a lot of time with recently:</p>
      <ol class="games">
        <li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">Stellaris</a></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>A strategy game where you take control of a spacefaring empire in order to dominate the galaxy.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/233095/">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</a></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>An incredible story-focused game about teenagers piloting giant robots that has some of the wildest twists and turns in any story I've ever played.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>  
        <li><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/">Yakuza 0</a></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>A brilliant open world game set in the underworld of Tokyo and Osaka, that frequently mixes serious dramatic storytelling moments with over-the-top weirdness (trust me, it works).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>  
      </ol>
